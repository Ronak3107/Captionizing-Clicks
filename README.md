# Captionizing-Clicks
## Project Overview -
You saw an image and your brain can easily tell what the image is about, but can a computer tell what the image is representing? Computer vision researchers worked on this a lot and they considered it impossible until now! With the advancement in Deep learning techniques, availability of huge datasets and computer power, we can build models that can generate captions for an image.

This is what we are going to implement in this Python based project where we will use deep learning techniques of Convolutional Neural Networks and a type of Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) together.

Captionizing Clicks is a deep learning project aimed at generating descriptive captions for images. By leveraging the Flickr8k dataset, VGG16 for feature extraction, and an LSTM model for sequence prediction, the project demonstrates how machine learning can interpret and describe visual content.

## Introduction
This project involves training a neural network to generate captions for images. The model combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) for sequence generation.

## Dataset
The Flickr8k dataset is used for training and evaluation. It consists of 8,000 images, each with five different captions describing the scene.

## Model Architecture
The project utilizes the following architecture:

### Feature Extraction:

VGG16: A pre-trained VGG16 model is used to extract features from images. The fully connected layers are removed to obtain feature vectors from the last convolutional layer.
Caption Generation:

LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to generate captions based on the features extracted by VGG16.
